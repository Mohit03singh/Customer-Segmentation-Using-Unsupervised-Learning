<h1>Customer_segmentation_using_unsupervised_learning</h1> 

This project utilizes unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By grouping customers with similar characteristics together, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to specific customer segments, thereby maximizing customer satisfaction and profitability.

**Introduction**

Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to understand their customer base better and cater to their needs effectively. Unsupervised learning algorithms like k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, or Gaussian mixture models can automatically identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing patterns, demographics, or other relevant features.This project provides a scalable and flexible framework for customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques. It allows businesses to input their customer data and apply clustering algorithms to identify meaningful customer segments.


**Dependencies**

Python (>= 3.6)

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

matplotlib (optional for visualization)

**Methodology**

**Data Preprocessing:**

Handling missing values
Scaling features
Encoding categorical variables

**Clustering:**

Applying K-Means clustering to segment customers
Using the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
Evaluating clustering performance

**Visualization:**

Visualizing the customer segments
Analyzing the characteristics of each segment
Results
The results of the clustering analysis are discussed in detail in the Jupyter notebook. Visualizations such as scatter plots and cluster distribution charts help illustrate the distinct customer segments identified by the model.
